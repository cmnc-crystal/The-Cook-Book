      <h2>How to Make this Korokke</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Wash the potatoes under cold running water. Peel the potatoes with a vegetable peeler.</li>
          <li>Cut each potato into equal 4 pieces. Tip: To cook evenly, it's important that they are of similar size.</li>
          <li>
            Put the water and potatoes in a large pot, cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat, 
           <br> leaving the lid slightly ajar to prevent the pot from boiling over. 
           <br> It will take about 15 minutes to come to a boil. 
            <br>Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle boil and cook until done, about 15-20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the rest of the ingredients while you wait for the potatoes to cook. 
           <br> First, mince the onion finely: Cut the onion in half from root end to tip. 
           <br> Lay one half flat on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, 
           <br> make ¼-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. 
            <br>Next, make ¼-inch horizontal slices, keeping the root end intact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, cut perpendicular down through the first slices you made. 
            <br>If the onion pieces need to be chopped finer, you can run your knife through them in a rocking motion. 
            <br>Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions are going to go flying around the room. 
            <br>Repeat with the other half.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large skillet, heat the oil on medium heat and add the chopped onions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sauté the onions until translucent and tender, about 12-15 minutes. 
            <br>Tip: Make sure there is no moisture left in the onions so that the croquette don't get soggy. 
            <br>Leave the chopped onions for a long stretch between stirring to give them a nice char. Take care not to burn the onions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the meat to the pan and break it up with a wooden spoon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season the mixture with salt and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir to combine and cook until the meat is no longer pink. 
            <br>Turn off the heat and remove the pan from the stove to let it cool slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once in a while, check if the potatoes are done cooking. 
            <br>Insert a skewer into a bigger piece of potato; if it pierces the potato easily, it's done. 
            <br>Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain off the water completely. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Move the pot back to the stove. Shake the pot over low heat and let the remaining moisture completely evaporate 
            <br>(without burning the potatoes), about 2-3 minutes. Then, transfer them to a large bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            With a potato masher, mash the potatoes while they are still hot, allowing the steam to escape in the process. 
            <br>Add the butter. Tip: Keep some potato chunks for texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the salt and pepper and combine well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the drained meat mixture to the bowl with the mashed potatoes and mix to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the mixture is still warm (but not hot), form it into oval-shaped patties<br> roughly 3 inches in length. 
            Take care not to create air pockets in the patties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Placed the patties on a tray or plate. Cover and let the Korokke patties rest in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare one tray each for the flour and the panko. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat with a fork.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dredge each patty in flour and shake off the excess.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, dip each patty in the egg and coat with the panko, pressing the breadcrumbs to make sure they adhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you finish breading the patties, add the oil to a medium pot. 
            <br>Make sure there's at least 2 inches (5 cm) of oil in the pot so the croquettes are completely submerged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring the oil to 340-350ºF (171-178ºC) over medium heat. Use a cooking thermometer to check the oil temperature. 
            <br>Once you get used to deep-frying, you can use the chopstick to determine if the oil is ready for deep-frying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep-fry 2-3 croquettes at a time until they are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. 
            <br>Tip: Do not touch the croquettes until one side is golden brown. 
            <br>The inside is already cooked, so all you need to do is to fry until they're golden brown!
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the croquettes to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. 
           <br> Continue deep-frying the rest of the patties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the croquettes with tonkatsu sauce or any other sauce. 
           <br> Typically, deep-fried foods are served with shredded cabbage in Japan.
